# EmotionalAI

My work for the Emotional AI research project at KSU.

The goal for this initial portion of the research is to enhance state-of-the-art LLMs with domain-specific datasets to achieve better results in mental health app recommendations.

Our criteria for rating accuracy is that the output apps must explicitly advertise the queried mental health condition, and users must express that the app helps with the condition.

Our results show that our dataset-enhanced LLMs achieved 10%-39% higher accuracy, variety, and quality of output than standard state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Results also show that dataset enhancement enables cheaper and less sophisticated LLMs to outperform state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks.
