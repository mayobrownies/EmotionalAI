# EmotionalAI

This is my work for the Emotional AI research project at KSU.

The goal for this initial portion of the research is to enhance state-of-the-art LLMs with domain-specific datasets to achieve better results in mental health app recommendations.

Our criteria for rating accuracy is that the output apps must explicity advertise the queried mental health condition and users must express that the app helps with the condition.

Our results show our dataset enhanced LLMs achieving 10%-39% higher accuracy, higher variety, and higher quality in outputs than standard state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Results also show that with dataset enhancement, cheaper and less sophisticated LLMs can outperform state-of-the-art LLMs in domain specific tasks.
